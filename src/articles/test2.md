Many people dread the morning, but there are ways to make it work for you. By following these simple tips, you can get the most out of your mornings.

## Wake up early

It’s been said that the early bird gets the worm. Well, that might be true, but getting up early has a lot of other benefits, too.

There are a few tricks to getting up early that make it a little bit easier.

The first is to go to bed at a reasonable time. If you’re trying to get up at 5 am but you go to bed at midnight, you’re not going to have much success.

The second trick is to make sure your alarm is set for the time you want to wake up and put it across the room so you have to get out of bed to turn it off.

Finally, try not to hit the snooze button!

So why is getting up early so beneficial? One reason is that it gives you a chance to get some peace and quiet before the day starts. You can use this time to do some relaxation exercises or just enjoy some quiet time alone.

## Make a plan the night before

One of the best ways to start your day is to have a plan for what you want to accomplish. If you wake up and try to figure out what you need to do, you’ll likely be less productive than if you take some time the night before to plan your day. By preparing a schedule and prioritizing your tasks, you can make sure that you get the most important things done.

It’s also a good idea to prepare for the next day before going to bed. This means setting out any clothes or materials you’ll need, as well as making sure that everything is ready for the next morning so that you don’t have to rush around trying to get ready. Taking a few minutes to plan ahead can help ensure a more productive morning and day overall.

One of my favorite ways is to plan the next day before going to sleep using the 3P strategy.

## Get moving

When you wake up in the morning, the first thing you should do is move. Get your blood flowing and your body moving.

You don’t need to go to the gym or do a hardcore workout; just take a walk around the block, go up and down the stairs a few times, or do some jumping jacks.

A little bit of movement will get your day started on the right foot and help you be more productive.

## Eat (a proper) breakfast

When you wake up in the morning, your body and mind are both starting from scratch. You’ve gone hours without food or water, and your brain is just starting to power up.

To make the most of your morning — and set yourself up for a productive day — you need to eat breakfast.

A good breakfast should include some protein, carbohydrates, and healthy fats. That might mean scrambled eggs with whole-wheat toast, yogurt with fruit and granola, or an omelet with avocado and tomatoes. Whatever you choose, make sure it’s something that will give you sustained energy throughout the day.

Skipping breakfast is a bad idea; it can leave you feeling tired and irritable by lunchtime. And if you think that eating breakfast means eating unhealthy foods like sugary cereal or pastries, think again.

## Hydrate

Water is key for a productive morning. Drinking a cup of water when you wake up helps to rehydrate your body after a long night of sleep.

Additionally, starting your day with water can help to jumpstart your metabolism and get your day off to a productive start. If you don’t like the taste of plain water, try adding some fruit juice or drinking from a water bottle with a fruit infusion.

Drinking plenty of fluids throughout the day, especially water, is important for keeping your body hydrated and functioning at its best.

How I implement it: I leave a water bottle (filtered or otherwise) on top of my night drawer next to my bed so that I have it in reach even during the night. I also take some vitamins and minerals and swallow them with water.

## Make time for yourself

In order to be our best selves, we need to make time for ourselves. When we carve out time each morning to do something that we enjoy or that is productive, it sets the tone for the rest of the day.

Maybe your hobby is painting, programming, or writing (like myself). A side hustle could be copywriting or tutoring. No matter what it is, make sure you schedule it and stick to it.

It’s important to have something that is just for you, outside of work and family obligations. I like to use my free time before starting work or everyday life full of errands and obligations for writing. Especially writing articles on my blog.

This can help relieve stress and promote a more positive outlook on life. Taking some time for yourself can also give you the extra energy you need to tackle the day head-on.

Getting the best of your mornings will make you productive. This means getting enough sleep, eating a healthy breakfast, and taking some time for yourself. If you can start your day off in this way, you will be more likely to have a successful day.
